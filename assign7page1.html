          <p class="welcome">Make sure all your links change color when you roll over them (even the link in the h1). The navigation link boxes are all the same width regardless of the amount of text inside. Make the nav link backgrounds change when you roll over them. The main header and navigation have gradients in the background. Clicking on the ISU image in the footer should open the ISU main site in a new window/tab. All three of your pages should have the same format for the headers, navigation, and footer. This paragraph is justified, the others are not.</p>
