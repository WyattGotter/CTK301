					<p class="p1">Collecting these pieces of art, along with documenting them, took time. However, making them took even longer. For the last five years, I have enjoyed creating content, and consuming other pieces artists have created. To call this a "best of" collection may be stretching it for some people. But for me, it may be true. Each of these pieces share memories in my mind, what I was feeling, and my journey as an artist. I am satisfied with this body of work, and I hope you get a level of satisfaction while viewing these while I gain a level of satisfaction making them.<br><br> - Wyatt Gotter</p>
